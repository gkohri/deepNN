This is an implementation of deep neural networks aimed at 
maximal performance.

The code is written in C++.  The back propagation learning is implemented 
as matrix multiplication using the Eigen library. This is made possible 
through the so-called mini-batch learning algorithm. Matrix multiplication in
Eigen runs at near optimal performance on SSE architectures.
